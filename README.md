# OpenCardiographySignalMeasuringDevice

This repository covers the development process of hardware and software as well as resuls analysis, for an open-source Cardiography Signal Measuring Device. On this page, you will be able to find all of CAD files for the 3D printed parts, gerber files for PCB fabrication, all of the code needed for the project as well test results of the data analysis. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me! The goal of the project was to be able to record and analyze these signals:

1. Arm Cuff Air Pressure Signals
2. Electrocardiography Signals (ECG)
3. Phonocardiography Signals (Stethoscope)
4. Photoplethysmography Signals (PPG)

This project was developed as my Master Thesis project at the University of Belgrade - School of Electrical Engineering (www.etf.bg.ac.rs), under the mentoship of prof. Nadica MiljkoviÄ‡.
